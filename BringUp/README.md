This schematic + code can be used to bring-up this design by using a microcontroller to drive the inputs and outputs of the design, simulating ROM and RAM and a serial port.

If the 5401 writes to memory address 0xEF twice, the micro will combine the two values in a character to send over its UART.

Although I used a ESP32-C3 devboard, any ESP32 devboard supporting the Arduino API can be used. Just wire up the GPIO Ports by their number according to the schematic. If thatâ€™s not possible, you can change the defines at the top of ``main.cpp`` to change which ports are used.
